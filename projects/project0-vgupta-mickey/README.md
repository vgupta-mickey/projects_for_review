# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


In this project, I have developed a personal website about me. The goal of the project is to build the personal website that works for all type of screens. The site is designed for mobil first in mind. The project is focused on making the site  responsive and usable. It is not focused for personal content. So, please ignore personal contents as they are kept limited intentionaly.

This website has 4 HTML pages:

1. Home
2. Aboutme
3. Gallery
4. Contact

You can switch to any page by click navbar options.

1. Home page has my background picture, my name and designation. The page is responsive as I change the screen size. Each page has Bootstrap navbar to switch between the pages.
2. Aboutme page use the Bootstrap Grid with 2 rows. First row always uses 12 columns for all type of screen. However, the second row uses 2 columns and is responsive as screen size changes. The page wrapped using bootstrap "container-fluid" class.
3.Gallery page is all about my collection of pictures. It uses flex-basis and display: grid method along with media queries to make them responsive. Photos display changes based on the screen size. Also the capton font-size changes based on the screen size.
4. Contact page is designed to let visitor to contact me in case they want to contact. I uses table and form and uses overflow-x: auto option to make it responsive. As screen size changes, the table, form  contents also shrinks. The font size changes depending on the screen size.


The following artifacts are  included:

1. index.html (Home page)
2. aboutme.html
3. gallery.html
4. contact.html
